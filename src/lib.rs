//! hydrogen is a non-blocking Edge Triggered TCP socket lib built atop [epoll][epoll-man-page]
//! with performance, concurrency, and scalability as its main priorities. It takes care of the
//! tedious connection and I/O marshalling across threads, and leaves the specifics of I/O reading
//! and writing up the consumer, through trait implementations.
//!
//! # Streams
//!
//! hydrogen manages the state of connections through [`hydrogen::Stream`][stream-trait]
//! [Trait Objects][trait-objects].
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! hydrogen reports all events to the [`hydrogen::Handler`][handler] passed during creation.
//! Interaction to `hydrogen::Stream` trait objects is made through a simple wrapper,
//! `HydrogenSocket`, to ensure thread safety.
//!
//! # Example Usage
//!
//! The following is a simple snippet using the [simple-stream][simple-stream-repo] crate to
//! provide the non-blocking I/O calls.
//!
//!
//! ```ignore
//! extern crate hydrogen;
//! extern crate simple_stream as ss;
//!
//! use hydrogen;
//! use hydrogen::{Stream as HydrogenStream, HydrogenSocket};
//! use ss::frame::Frame;
//! use ss::frame::simple::{SimpleFrame, SimpleFrameBuilder};
//! use ss::{Socket, Plain, NonBlocking, SocketOptions};
//!
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! pub struct Stream {
//!     inner: Plain<Socket, SimpleFrameBuilder>
//! }
//!
//! impl HydrogenStream for Stream {
//!     fn recv(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<Vec<u8>>, Error> {
//!         match self.inner.nb_recv() {
//!             Ok(frame_vec) => {
//!                 let mut ret_buf = Vec::<Vec<u8>>::with_capacity(frame_vec.len());
//!                 for frame in frame_vec.iter() {
//!                     ret_buf.push(frame.payload());
//!                 }
//!                 Ok(ret_buf)
//!             }
//!             Err(e) => Err(e)
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn send(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!         let frame = SimpleFrame::new(buf);
//!         self.inner.nb_send(&frame)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn shutdown(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!         self.inner.shutdown()
//!     }
//! }
//! impl AsRawFd for Stream {
//!     fn as_raw_fd(&self) -> RawFd { self.inner.as_raw_fd() }
//! }
//!
//!
//! struct Server;
//! impl hydrogen::Handler for Server {
//!     fn on_server_created(&mut self, fd: RawFd) {
//!
//!     }
//!
//!     fn on_new_connection(&mut self, fd: RawFd) -> Arc<UnsafeCell<HydrogenStream>> {
//!
//!     }
//!
//!     fn on_data_received(&mut self, socket: HydrogenSocket, buffer: Vec<u8>) {
//!
//!     }
//!
//!     fn on_connection_removed(&mut self, fd: RawFd, err: Error) {
//!
//!     }
//! }
//!
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     hydrogen::begin(Server, hydrogen::Config {
//!         addr: "0.0.0.0".to_string(),
//!         port: 1337,
//!         max_threads: 8,
//!         pre_allocated: 100000
//!     });
